# The jenkins-utils Travis CI/CD configuration.
language: python

os:
- linux

# Our build stages.
# (`test` is basically a travis default default so we don't need to name it).
# But we do want a `deploy` stage that only runs if the the commit is tagged
# (with a label that begins `pypi-` and it's on the master branch).
# Our tags for PyPI distributions will be of the form `pypi-1.0.1`.
stages:
- name: test
- name: deploy
  if: tag is present

# Run Travis on all branches
# (normally it only runs on master)
branches:
  only:
  - "/.*/"

# Installation steps.
# We have more than one requirements file.
install:
- pip install -r package-requirements.txt
- pip install -r requirements.txt

# Test/build execution steps...
# All in the default 'test' stage.
script:
- pyroma .
- pylint im_jenkins_server.py
- python setup.py bdist_wheel

# Execution jobs.
# Let's run the script against various Python versions
# and then move to our deploy stage. Travis will only run the deploy stage
# when the test stages have passed. Deployment will also only execute
# if this triggering commit is tagged and we're on the master branch.
jobs:
  include:
  - python: 3.6

  - stage: deploy
    python: 3.6
    # No need to re-run scripted commands here.
    # They're all part of the above test stages.
